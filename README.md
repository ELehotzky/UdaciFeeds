Project 4 for Udacity FEND Program

*About*
=======
Hello! This is a fairly simple app, showing the benefits of test-driven development using Jasmine for JavaScript testing.

*Get Started*
=============
Getting started is simple - download the files and open the index.html file in your browser. Jasmine is already integrated, and you should see all of the tests (seven total) passing if you scroll to the bottom of the page.

Play around with it! Go into the /js/app.js file and start tinkering with the code, commenting out lines of feed names, urls, etc. Refresh your browser and you should see some of the tests failing. 

*Dependencies*
==============
This app was created with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and the Jasmine JS framework for testing.
